Accidentally this project made me more aware that my personal files aren't personal anymore when I upload them to file hosting services and there's a small "story" to it:  
    I never shared credentials of my FTP accounts I tested this project with and the only places where I placed "keys.exe" were:
* 2 of my pcs
* pc at my school
* mediafire hosting service

When "keys.exe" is executed it connects to the FTP server and creates a folder named by the user who executed it. To my surprise aside from my usernames few other folders were created by users called:
* admin
* Apiary
* David
* JohnDoe
* luser
* Roger
* STRAZNJICAGRUBUTT

That was the point where I added screenshot and "sysinfo" functionality to the project, shortly after that I checked "WHOIS" for each of the collected IP addresses which showed the following results:
* RIPE Network Coordination Centre (using 3 different IPs over the time)
* Integra Telecom, Inc. (ITCM)
* Cythereon Inc.
* Peak 10, Inc.
* Asia Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC)
* Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT-Z)
* Wintek Corporation WINTEK-NET2

Results which still didn't clarify to me what exactly is the purpose of such testing... The screenshots also didn't clarify much.
